==================
Report of officers
==================

** President: Angelica **

1) Ski Retreat
Angelica has met with the contact person last week and has price quotes -- he needs a package decision soon.

Package Option 1:
Apex resort - 2 nights, lift tickets, and round-trip transportation provided, plus prize give aways and coupon book for rentals/lessons. Guides are also provided, and there's less work for Angelica. Also, good things have been heard about company.

Package Option 2: Big White - Big White & Silverstar, Kelowna. Will be staying at Holiday Inn, which provides breakfast. The mountains are also supposedly better.
Johnson has been to Big White, but does not remember much besides the long trip time.

The trip will occur during the first weekend after school beings in January.

While all the discussion is going on, Noah can been seen stacking cream cups into an octahedron. Crazy Noah.

Johnson suggests having day trip instead, but the idea is shot down since overnight is so much more fun.

Kinesiology student association wants in on the trip. There are lots of oppertunitites for joint events. A suggestion is made to take over a mountain with all the CS student unions in the world. First a mountain, then the world, followed shortly by the universe.

Angelica is leaning towards Big White. Deadline is Nov. 6. There are good deals for big groups, so the more people we get, the cheaper it is relatively. Angelica volunteers Noah to talk to the engineers about future joint events. Noah is slightly hesitant due to the tension caused by his counter-cheer during Frosh Week. Eh, too bad.

2) Yearbook
The engineers have a year book and Angelica is envious. It apparently cost them about $3,000 to produce. UBC CSSS has CD-ROM year-books. There's a lot of work and cost involved with producing these things, especially of the paper-printed variety. Getting photos for everything is hard. Travis suggests using PhotoAssasin.
Mike points out that keeping the CSSS web-site updated is more worthwhile at less cost. Printed books have more of that material value. Lack of concrete and synchronized graduation dates make planning for one difficult. Possibly make yearly issues.

3) DiGRA
Digital Games Research Association is having their next conference in Vancouver sometime in June. They want CSSS to help organize/plan/run events, especially an enormous LAN party downtown. Eugene Chan has this crazy idea that it's outdoor, and asks about what's going to happen when it rains. No, LAN parties are not usually held outdoors.
Infrastructure is a big problem, both acquiring and maintaining them, as well as security. Angelica has not yet replied to DiGRA's requests.

The following people volunteered to accompany Angelica to next meeting with the liaison: Jim, Jeff, Ryan, Sepand, Dominic, Travis, Diego, Yang, Noah, Eugene Chin, and Tim.

4) Accenture
Accenture wants to sponsor us for something.
Noah points out that the policies for corporate relations, although talked about, was never actually drafted: this would be a good time to get that done.
Chicken noises are heard from Omar, who quickly silences the device of origin. Laughter ensues, and obligatory fun-poking follows.
Bishnu will be prodded by Noah to continue working on the committee to work on the drafting of said policies.

No further discussions on the topic.

5) CUTC
Canadian Undergraduate Technology Conference is coming up in January -- basically a big gathering of students to talk about technology stuff and party.
Angelica will approach department for funding. Yay money.



** VP Operations: Noah **

There was a bubble-tea meeting between the WICS and CSSS executive. No plans were made, but met some new people.
Attended engineers' meeting, where they had beer tasting. Jeff comments that "we suck". They are also really formal, using a lot of bureaucratic jargon when putting forward things to vote on.
Eugene Chan is looking over Yang's shoulder and starts laughing. Noah gets suspicious and asks Yang to read back the minutes. See, nothing suspicious is going on here at all.

Engineers are planning paint-ball on Oct 30.
An "Applied Science Informal" has been suggested to compliment the AS formal, sometime during the Fall (pub-night, etc.)
Communications Student Union is also having a pub night soon. The VPO will take the opportunity to work on some inter-departmental relationships while being intoxicated.

Finally, Noah shows off his cream-cup octahedron. Jeff resolves to knock it over.


** VP Resource: Travis **
Busy talking to Andy: will report later.


** VP Activities: Jeff **
Jeff has a hearty laugh at Noah after the octahedron of creaminess is knocked over by some random meat bag. Noah is sad.

Things are going well. Pizza demand is up, and future orders will be larger -- they're apparently cheaper in mod 3.
Jeff wants to have a Halloween event -- cheesy scary movies, etc. Johnson wants to go rock-climbing, but is ignored. Will probably be held on Friday instead of Sunday the 31st. A costume contest is being thought about, possibly giving bonus points for geeky-ness. Noah switches to Captain Kirk mode and interrupts: "Khaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan!"
Funding for logistics and volunteers judges are needed. Noah suggests having people pay to leave, unless they stay for the whole event, and make a profit. Probably won't work in the atrium.

Jeff motions for an extra $20 to spend on Halloween movies for Oct 29 on top of the weekly pizza events; seconded by Omar. Motion passes.

Mailing list for event volunteers will be made. Noah interrupts again, this time with the signature evil villain laugh.
Costume judge volunteers: Jen, Angelica, Sepand, and Omar.

The atrium has already been booked for the end-of-semester social.

Engineers are holding a pub crawl soon: everyone is invited to come along. More information to come.


** VP Resource: Travis (take 2) **
Can't seem to stop talking to Andy, and steals Noah's laptop. Noah offers to dance in the meantime. 
Travis once again takes too long to start reporting, and is moved back.


** Exec @ Large: Tim **
Has suffered paper cuts in the line of duty. Poor baby.
New cabinet has been successfully acquired. Yay, new cabinet. However, keys aren't available yet. Booo! Tim blames Angelica for not picking up keys.

Other than that, Tim's been getting dragged around to phantom jobs.


** VP Resource: Travis (take 3) **
Travis finally steps up with two PowerBooks in his arms -- third time's the charm, it seems.

A poem is presented:

	Three keys for the Cola-kings under the lights,
	Seven keys for the Geek-lords in their halls of seats,
	Nine for the cabinet doomed to use,
	One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne,
	Upon Mt. Burnaby where the shadows lie.
	One Ring to Rule them all, One Ring to find them,
	One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
	Upon Mt. Burnaby where the geeks lie.

("The One Ring" referred to above is the key-ring which contains keys to practically everything, recently lost from the cabinet)

The One Ring has been reforged, except for the Minolta key for the photocopier.

There is now pop. Yay, pop! There's enough to last for a while. Copier is working, and stuff's been getting fixed.

Travis motions: Be it resolved that Travis be compensated up to $130 in compensation for locks and other repair/replacement costs upon the presentation of receipts; seconded by Michael. Motion passes.


** Treasurer: Eugene **
Deposits are being made weekly.

Account balance was good untill Travis bought pop: had ~$2500, subtract ~$1400 for beverages, ~$850 for catering, then even more to compensate Travis and Sepand. Estimated to have $100 or less left when the current batch of payments are done.

Eugene is not sure how much is currently left in the pop machine, but estimates it to be approximately $150. Photocopier income is a bit slow these days: wonders why people aren't copying things for midterms. Bit worried about the current status of revenue. Cheque from EA hasn't been cashed yet, but right now things are "not good".

Since it's still mid semester, things will probably pick up again. We probably can't spend much money for the next while.


** Secretary: Yang **
Four minutes in total to be approve for this meeting: they're being passed around. The web-site has been updated with new information. Updating it through the back-end is painful.
