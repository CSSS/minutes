President calls the meeting to order at 3:40pm
Justin apologises for the meeting in the common room.

1) Report of the Officers
	President (Justin Price):
		Nothing much to report.
		All new officers have signing authority and it was done quickly.
		Justin was unable to attend a school meeting 2 weeks ago, Noah
		made gave an overview.
		Justin mentioned that there is some grad recruitment going on
		next Monday and so ended his report.

	VP Resources (Andy Lumb):
		Chris Fawcett complains about the non-existence of Ruby Red.
		Andy has done basic pop numbers and the photocopier is running
		as it usually does. Total current estimate of income from the
		pop machine is $74/week. Chris comments that that seems low.

	VP Activities (Noah Adams):
		There was a WICS-CSSS joint meeting last weekend.
		There will be a wings night next Tuesday at approximately 5:30.
		  If funding passes it'll be free.
		The next event may be a bowling nite on the 15th, the Sunday
		  during the reading break.
		LAN party on the 20th of February. Stuff will get booked, food
		  will exist. The LAN will make use of the LAN supplies
		  purchased last semester.
		Considering having snow inner tubing at Cypress on the 6/7th of
		  March.
		Possibly a skating even on March 20th, maybe joint with UBC.
		Formal later in the semester and more will be figured out later.		  
		There is some talk about making sure that the room is booked.
		Possibly a camping retreat at the end of semester or into
		  summer. Allison lake was proposed.
		There is currently an offer from the Engineering Student
		  Society for movie tickets at $9 a ticket. There are currently
		  no movies planned but it's cheap and a good idea.
                *****************************************************************
		Noah motions to spend up to $700 on movie vouchers. It is 
		  seconded by Chris Fawcett. Motion passes.
		Noah motions to spend up to $200 for wings and nachos for the
		  wings night. Seconded by Chris Fawcett. Motion passes.
		*****************************************************************

		There is some discussion about the date of bowling, ending with
		  people noting that Noah doesn't work all that hard currently.

		*****************************************************************
		Noah motions for money for bowling, $200. Bowling on Sunday the
		  15th of February. Due to concerns about studying and such.
		  Seconded by Andy. Motion passes.

	Treasurer (Chris Fawcett):
		Finances are fine, we have tons of money in the bank and money
		  in the back room to be put in.
		Income seems good, but Chris doubts Andy's estimates as low.

	Secretary (Travis Brown):
		Travis apologizes for the room, apparently there was a mixup.
		Travis brings up the state of lemma and the fact that the
		  current web page is being put up, but PHP is hating us.

2) Tibi's TV item comes up, but since he's not here, Noah gives a summary that
	it is a TV with the appropriate connections to attach to laptops so
	that people don't need to hang around laptops.
	Jeremy rants that it is a bad idea and that it in far too intrusive.

3) Justin gives Andy open floor. Andy brings up that there has been some talk
	of putting a Ramen machine into the MTF. The machine carries oriental
	noodles and Asian snacks. It also includes a free hot water dispenser.
	Jeremy ask if there is underwear in a can. Andy say no.
	Justin brings up the cost. Andy mentions that it will not cost anything.
	  Either a percentage back of sales, or $1000/year will be paid to the
	  CSSS. Some adjustment is possible and Andy has asked to look at the
	  contract.
	There is discussion to bargain up to 25%. Justin brings up checking the
	  contracts for the other food vending machines.
	Chris asked about the location. Andy responds that a cabinet could be
	  removed to make room.

	************************************************************************
	Andy motions to go ahead and get the vending machine at an appropriate
	  percentage. CSIL, other contracts, etc. allowing. Seconded by Chris
	  Fawcett. Motion passes.
	************************************************************************

3) Justin asks for other issues. None appear and Noah gets the floor.
	Noah: Yesterday Greg Baker comes in and asks if the CSSS is sending
	  somebody to a school meeting. An emergency school meeting was called.
	  Noah went. The school is way below DTP targets. If 60 new people
	  enter they are still around 100 FTEs short. There is a summary of
	  the last 2 years of the numbers of new FTEs in the school. Currently
	  the school is halfway through the DTO period and they are vastly
	  behind. This is worth $700,000 cumulatively to the school.
	  Differential tuition was also discussed.
	  There was a motion in to lower the internal transfer GPA and to not
	  advertise the direct entry GPA, but instead say that there are empty
	  seats.
	There is some discussion about the changes.
	There is some discussion about who will make the vote that the CSSS is
	  given. Justin explains how he does it.
	Noah gives some numbers for the guaranteed entry program. Overall less
	  that 50% of those in the program will not be going on in the CS program.
	It is mentioned that this implies a dumbing down of courses.

	There is then some discussion on the funding situation. The funding
	  that the school already has is going to stay.
	Noah states that the school currently has plenty of money, but that
	  some feel that it is foolish to give away $700000.
	Chris mentions that this may make the CS program a backdoor to English
	  or such. Do we want to reduce the standing of the school?
	Mike brings up the internal transfers. He asks if  they are going to
	  change any of its requirements. Greg answers that changing the
	  structure of anything like that requires a calendar change, which
	  requires more than a year.
	Noah asks if this motion would be a permanent change to the internal
	  transfer GPA. Greg answers that it will most likely be a short term
	  thing since it isn't intended to be a permanent change.
	Greg says that he agrees with out take on the issue. He says that
	  bringing people in just to kick them out would be to become like the
	  Engineers this past semester. He says that he sees 3 possible
	  outcomes:
		1. Lower standards
		2. More students requiring help
		3. Kicking students out as soon as they enter
	There is some discussion between Jeremy and Greg about the
	  possibilities of these outcomes. It is mentioned that since the
	  early admission date is near and that changing the required
	  percentage is too late.
	Noah mentions that maybe the BC registration system could be 'dealt
	  with'
	Justin mentions that the standing of the CS department in SFU has
	  decreased somewhat, and that it is this reputation that draws good
	  people.
	Kyle questions how DTO helps the school. It is answered that it helps
	  the faculty and research. Noah notes that there has been no increase
	  in graduate support. Justin mentions that very little goes back to
	  the undergrads.

	Justin asks for anything else.
	Noah proposes that the CSSS opposes any changes that would adversely
	  affect the quality of the program. He also mentions in response to
	  Kyle's thought that it would allow those who didn't do so well at
	  high school but are good at CS to get in that there is little
	  competition for seats.
	Justin says that he feel that reduced tuition and increased recruitment
	  would be better.
	Justin calls for a motion on out position.

	************************************************************************
	Bishnu motions that we disagree with this ballot which has to do with
	  reducing the GPA for internal transfers and reducing the entrance
	  average from high school. Noah seconds.
	Mike says the issue is making sure that these people graduate.
	Motion passes.
	*************************************************************************

	Justin asks what we will do now that we have disagreed with it. Better
	  recruitment is suggested. Justin wants something more immediate.
	Noah suggest that everybody tell their opinion about this vote to
	  their prof's, even if they don't know them all that well.
	Greg returns and applauds Noah for his involvement.

	Noah then goes about listing the positions that he felt people were
	  holding in the meeting. He lists some prominent member of the faculty
	  that are against it. He recaps with that Greg was right that it was
	  too late to go for students now for the Fall semester.
	Justin brings up that most people came here for the program reputation.
	  He feels that we need to commit to helping the school with recruitment
	  and retention. He also want the active community to grow.

	There is some discussion on the improvements this year with the number
	  of active first years. And it is considered good and that it will
	  get better in the future.
	Justin goes back to getting people to talk to their profs about how
	  they do not want the program quality to be decreased.

	There is some discussion about how the CSSS works and committees in
	  general and Jeremy brings up that he feels that there is not enough
	  decentralization of responsibilities within the CSSS.
	Justin brings up that things work better when people spearhead things
	  and asked if anybody would like to spearhead it and help get students
	  to help out because there are more of us than there are faculty.
	  Justin said he would start up a mailing list and send the information
	  to cmpt-all. He also wants a paper petition started and the
	  information put out to cmpt-students. It is planned to start this
	  tonight.

	The general consensus is to do the above.
	
	***************************************************************************
	Noah motions for the CSSS to be in strong opposition to any policy of
	  the school that would threaten the academic integrity of the program
	  at the undergraduate level. Seconded by Bishnu. Motion passes.
	***************************************************************************

4) Justin calls for any other issues. None come up.
	A letter will be drafted to the school and an email sent out to the
	  students. A petition will be started tomorrow and the society will
	  support the school's requests for help and find people to help.
	A random passerby asks who is in charge of the CS website.
	Justin asks again for other issues.
	Yang brings up powerbars, Justin says he's getting to it. Kyle
	  volunteers and Justin gives him money from discretionary funds.

5) Jeremy motions to adjourn, none oppose.

CSSS Meeting Adjourns.
