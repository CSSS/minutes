Agenda: 
conference funding for Simeon P.  
sailing club event      
pool table expenditure authorization    
general elections       
very brief open floor 

Conference Funding Authorization: Simeon P. wants to go to "Graphics Interface 2004".  It's a new fiscal year, so we have spent none of our allocation of the SFSS's travel budget for this year yet.  George L. motions to allocate to him $100, it is seconded by, uh, Morgan K. or someone, and in due course the motion passes consentaneously. 

Sailing Club Event: Our erstwhile Vice-President of Activities, Angelica L., allegedly proposes some sort of social event at the Hollyburn Sailing Club in West Vancouver.  The event, we are told that we are told, will involve hanging out in a clubhouse, possible sailing in small craft, and perhaps general duding around.  The proposed time, according to sources, is 1400 through 2200, Saturday the 15th of May.  He (allegedly) wishes to have money allocated for food and sundries.  Morgan K. so motions, is seconded by George L., and another rousing round of dissent-free voting passes the motion. Morgan K. motions to have Angelica L. flogged, and I'm sure someone seconded it, but no one will own up to having seconded it.  Denied. 
Pool Table Refurbishing Expenditures: Apparently Angelica L. got the pool table refelted and perhaps otherwise maintained, and it went over budget because the pool table is bigger than default and the estimator was not told this.  In a fit of mercy, the meeting authorizes the reimbursal of Angelica L.'s over-budget costs, to the tune of [up to, as necessary] $150, in a motion made by The Shwartz and seconded by George L.. On this subject, Noah A. points out that the pool table has cost the CSSS around $1400 already this year (although only including installation, mind you), and that this seems a bit steep, should this become a pattern.  He proposes that special effort be made to track the costs that the pool table incurs, 'cos if it needs refelting every six months, it's gonna be a problem.  Various suggestions are made to attempt to slow this wear and tear down.  Some random voice from the back suggests a sign saying "Do not stand on the pool table, do not dance on the pool table, refrain from being a monkey's asshat", or something like that.  Your narrator suggests that J. Random Pooltableuser has no emotional investment in the society, and consequently treats society property as abusable.  No real conclusions are drawn, but perhaps the next executive will implement the sign. 

Elections! 
---------- 
President:   
Nominated (nomination/second): 
Angelica L. (The Shwartz/Robert H.)    
The Shwartz (Johnson Y./Morgan K.) DECLINED   

Vote Results: Yes, we're willing to have a President, and we think Angelica L. is up to the job.   
Highlight: Noah A. reading out Angelica L.'s platform speech in the third person, and being uncomfortable about it 

Vice-President, Resources:   
Nominated:     
Robert H. (Morgan K./George L.)                  
Amy T. (mkow...) DECLINED                
George L. (jya...) DECLINED   

Vote Results: Yes, okay, Rob can continue to do the work that gets us revenue. 

Vice-President, Activities:   
Nominated:    Eugene C. (The Shwartz/Morgan K.)                 
Morgan K. (illegible/Simeon P.)    DECLINED                
John B. (The Shwartz/George L.)     (Morgan K. says "Airsoft")               
Johnson Y. (The Shwartz/George L.)   
Nominated and Declined too fast to have seconds, or even for me to record motioners: Amy T., The Shwartz, Sara G., Noah A., possibly also Jennifer F.   
Vote Results: Demonstrating that we actually can engage in non-unanimous voting (although there was doubt at a few points in the vote-count), John B. wins.  (Morgan K. says, perking up, "Did someone say Airsoft?")   
Take Note: John B. purports to represent, in at least some abstract sense, those members of the CSSS that are not as active as, say, nearly all meeting attendees.  I interpret this to be a commitment to involve more of those members, without (significantly) alienating any of the current members (except the really annoying ones). 

Treasurer:   
Nominated:       
Eugene C. (The Shwartz/George L.)                  
Jennifer F. (The Shwartz/Sara G.)                
The Shwartz (George L./Johnson Y.) DECLINED   
Not Nominated, due to past laziness: "Wishnu Kattacharaya"   

Vote Results: Uh, Jennifer F. wins, and I have run out of interesting things to say about it.  Except that she committed to keep her embezzlement take below 1/3 of society gross revenue. 

Secretary:   
Nominated:    
Eugene C. (David K./The Shwartz)                  
George L. (George L./The Shwartz)   
Vote Results:      If you were trapped in a room with two identical-seeming humanoids, but knew that one was an angel who always tells the truth and the other was a demon who always lies, and you said to one of the humanoids "What would you say if I asked you if Eugene C. won the election for CSSS Secretary in Summer of 2004, replacing Jeremy H.'s interim post?", you could safely expect the humanoid to answer "Yes, he did.", unless you weren't clear in your questioning what you meant by "Eugene C.", and the humanoids weren't very good at that sort of contextual thing. 

SFSS Forum Representative:   
Nominated:  
The Shwartz (Anthony L./George L.) DECLINED, BITCHES, I DECLINE ALREADY, GIVE IT A REST  
Morgan K. (George L./Simeon P.)              
George L. (Johnson Y./The Shwartz)   
Vote Results: Morgan K. gets the stipend. 

[4] Uh, then some acclamation was done on the subject of School committees. To the committee for hardware and software, or whatever it's called, we'll send The Shwartz and John B..  Should that committee ever meet, ha ha ha. 
To the UPC and its subsidiary the UCC, we'll send Noah A. and Yang Z.. 

Election Summary:         
President := Angelica L.      
VP-R := Robert H.     
VP-A := John B.        
Treasurer := Jennifer F.       
Secretary := Eugene C.        
Forum Rep := Morgan K.   
UPC/UCC Rep := {Noah A.,Yang Z.}       

Open Floor: Some time during the elections, Brandon N. had to go do something else, so we paused to let him speak briefly.  I'm told he's a nice guy, so I'll forgive the apparent obsequiousness of his self-intro.  Anyway, he's the current (new) president of the EUSS (reachable at euss-president@sfu.ca).  The main thing of consequence that he said was to announce that their Committee for the Preservation, Perpetration, and Promotion of Alcoholism is holding some event next Wednesday, starting at 1730 at the Highland Pub.  I'm told it costs $10, involves a t-shirt, some bus rides, some cheap drinks, and four downtown houses of ill repute.  Well, okay, not really ill repute, more sort of houses that are public.  Contact him for more info, or read the disgustingly huge sign over the walkway through the Atrium. Hmn, that whole thing came out sounding sort of unwontedly and unfairly hostile.  Oh well, it's traditional! cdemwell wants money to go to TAG+7, a conference here in Vancouver in a few weeks.  He wants $50 for himself (so motioned by Eugene C. and seconded by George L. and passed), and for some other person.  cdemwell cannot be reached by phone to identify the other person, so no money is allocated for this other.  But cdemwell gets his allocation of $50. 

Motion to Adjourn is made and unopposed at 1656.
