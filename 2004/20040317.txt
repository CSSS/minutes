Report of the officers
	VPR: pop still selling, very regularly. that's it.
	VPA: 3 new events coming up. Inner tubing was postponed. Apparently
		Semyour isn't as nice as we thought. Sign up, etc. up this/next
		week. 28th is the current planned date.	End of semester social.
		Kill Bill V2 on Sat. 2nd? April. Punisher looks like it will 
		suck so we most likely won't do it. Shrek 2 is out in May, 
		maybe, maybe not be in Noah's reign. App Sci formal. April 
		23rd. Have likely guarantees of money, ready to stat 
		advertising. Tickets currently $30 unsubsidized. There will be
		a bar. Subsidy will be discussed. ~$400 total for 40 tickets.
		DJ may end up being Noah's friend. Partying on with cheap room
		packages is being looked into. 30-40 tickets are expected to be
		sold. Max 1 per member + 1 guest. Money will be	requested next
		meeting.
	Treasurer: Gobs of money. Last deposit was around $3500 and is very
		heavy. We have around $4000-4500. Core budget is suggested for
		App Sci formal. These inaccurate numbers from the treasurer who
		isn't here, meaning, from what people who did attend could
		guess.
	President: Nothing has happened. Nothing actually happened, unlike
		last week.

Minutes: 
	***********************************************************************
	Morgan motions to approve the minutes. Seconded by Andy. Motion passes.
	***********************************************************************

Tech Fair:
	The continuance report from the last coordinator was received last
	week or soish. A summary of what Tech Fair is is made. Work needs to 
	be started right after exams are done. A leader is being requested.
	Mike has had enough. He calls for hands, none go up.
	Mike tries selling it again. There was a dismal showing last year.
	There is some discussion about the engineers version and why the
	showing was so bad last year for them.
	It is pointed out that the volunteer team doesn't need to start now,
	but needs to come together right after exams. The work load isn't that
	bad if you have a team of eight or so.
	It is mentioned that we may leave it for a year, but it's pointed out
	that if we do we'll most likely never start again.
	It is put away and people told to think about it.

End of Semester Social:
	The social will be the same old same old. Social will be April 6th.
	The date is discussed. There is not much that can be done, so we'll
	just need to keep this in mind when planning food and such. 
	The budget is detailed. $1100. There is some discussion about how this
	may be low compared to previous End of Semester Socials times.

	***********************************************************************
	Noah motions for up to $1500 to be spent on the End of Semester Social
	with the intent of reclaiming $400 from pizza. Seconded by Courteney.
	Motion Passes.
	***********************************************************************

	Noah calls for help because there is still a bunch of work to be done.
	Join csss-social. More volunteers the morning of will be grabbed. There
	is a meeting on Monday 3:30-4:30, room TBA.

Open floor:
	Andy: Andy starts. Rob raises his hand when he brings up the MTF. The
	pool table is in bad shape. Omar mentioned that ball 13 is MIA, but
	has been replaced. Andy asks for a list of missing balls. He's looking
	into the foosball since it is also in a	bad shape.
	Back to the topic at hand. New cues are needed. He is thinking of 
	refelting the table. Refelting can be done at the bottom of the hill
	for $320. Noah mentions that pool felt is really expensive. Security 
	of the cues is discussed.

	***********************************************************************
	Andy motions to spend $450 to reequip the pool table. Including
	refelting, new cues, new chalk, new balls, etc.
	=======================================================================
	There is some discussion on how much money it's costing us a ~$600
	year since we've had it not even a year. It is mentioned that the
	felt was already in questionable shape. The consensus is that it's
	worth it. It is discussed that leaving only 2 cues out reduces chances
	of cue breakages. Seeing if security can go around during the day is
	discussed.
	=======================================================================
	It is amended and accepted that only 2 cues be left out at any one
	time by Omar.
	=======================================================================
	Noah recommends keeping this in the continuounity report.

	Seconded by Omar. Motion Passes.
	***********************************************************************

	Noah: Noah proposes to buy flowers for the CS office staff. Mike
	defends it. It is planned to be a planned arrangement of about $200.
	Andy brings up the NAG due to being helpful for lemma stuff. Zook is
	also suggested for going out of the way. A large arrangement is
	suggested with personal thanks to the special people. Delivery is
	recommended. A call for somebody who knows flowers is suggested.
	
	***********************************************************************
	Noah motions for $200 for a flower arrangement for the CS office staff.
	Amended and accepted to $250 by Bishnu. Seconded by Morgan. Motion
	passes.
	***********************************************************************

	Noah asks that donations to the food bank and child care be an agenda
	item for next semester.

	John brings up CS wear. Mike brings up that the previous wear was
	horrible due to the logo. This guy proposes that over the summer a new
	logo be designed. He wonders if	the CSSS would subsidize.
	Bishnu asks who is 'we' that would put up the other $500 for the run.
	Noah brings up that shirts were tried this last fall. The current logo
	is a result of the logo contest.
	Kyle asks about a company in mind to do this through. It is in
	progress. Department subsidy is discussed. Justin tells John that he
	will give him any information he needs and that if he is asking for
	money he needs a budget. Wear types are	discussed. Using them for
	first week and a test run mid summer is suggested.
	
	Kyle open floor time. Go SFU seems to have received enough complaints
	that the interface will be done to fix the problems. Semester numbers
	is at the top of the list along with browser compatibility. All of
	this is from inside sources.
	Apparently complaining works well. 
	Justin wants the telereg voice back.
	The amount of difference from the current system is discussed and will
	most likely be limited to reduce head aches from upgrading.

	***********************************************************************
	Noah motions to adjourn.
	Noah objects.
	***********************************************************************

	***********************************************************************
	Noah motions to wish Andy a happy birthday. Seconded by Mike. Motion
	passes.
	***********************************************************************

	The room proceeds to sing "Happy Birthday to Andy" horribly off key.

	Mike motions to adjourn.
Motion Adjourns at 4:41.PM
