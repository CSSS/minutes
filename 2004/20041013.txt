Meeting called to order by Noah @ 16:31 

==================
Report of officers
==================

Angelica refuses to go first, so, moving on.

** VP Operations: Noah **
Haven't really done much except homework. Plans to pester the engineers soon. Was present at DiGRA meeting.

Nothing terrible happened while acting as temporary President, which is good.


** VP Resource: Travis **
Photocopier's been copying and pop relatated things are going as usual. There was a misestimation with the last order, so there's plenty of pop.
Copier lease is up and a Minolta rep will be coming for a meeting on Tuesday. Will bargain with the assumption that we do want to keep a copier around. More during open floor.


** President: Angelica **
Had a meeting with the ski-trip liaison, and has received information packages. Oooooo, fancy colour-printed packages.
Quite a few first-years were interested when asked about it. 
Yang volunteers to help make posters for advertising.

Trip information:
Jan 14-16 @ Silverstar/Big White -- it's the first weekend after classes start.
Early-bird prices available untill Nov. 5, with special lift ticket discount.

Business Object hasn't paid for frosh week yet, but money will be sent soon. Yay money! A meeting was held with Eugene and Jeff about budget situation.

Needs more advertising.


** VP Activities: Jeff **
About money: we have none.

Semester-end Social has a budget of $850. It'll be fun, but cheap.

2 movie nights are planned: The Incredibles on Nov 5, and Blade: Trinity around mid-December. There are still tickets left from previous movie nights, so there won't be much need for extra funding. Also, ticket costs are balanced out with their sales. Eugene has no idea how many are left exactly, however: it will be looked into.

LAN Party is planned for the first weekend in November, except it conflicts with movie night -- will be the second weekend instead.

Also, Jeff is not wearing shoes. Silly Jeff.


** Treasurer: Eugene **
There's current ~$600 in the account. There was a little over $1500 a while back, but SFU Catering cashed the payment cheque.

Revenue has been disappointing. Pop's starting to get going again. No idea why copier revenue is down.

Unfortunately, no more Frosh Week sponsorship money are coming in except the one from Business Objects.

Next pop order should be small, so funds should be fine.

Pizza sales: losing more than just the tip now, with costs going up or what not. Currently losing almost $60 per week. Jeff considers increasing pizza price to $1.50, but is met with resistance. There will be negotiations with Papa Joe's to try and get some deals.

Revenue will hopefully increase in the immediate future.

Frosh Week was under-budget, but the budget was ginourmous to begin with, and there were actually costs that weren't factored in. Only Andy's photo-hunt book production was over-budget.
The department will hopefully give us more money the next time around.


** Exec@Large: Tim **
Locksmith has been called, and keys are being cut. Angelica is impatient and asks for them anyway. They will be acquired on Friday or earlier. Distribution will occur on Monday.


** Secretary: Yang **
Minutes from last meeting is going around.
The bulletin board will have stuff on it sometime in the immediate future, hopefully Monday.
Advertising for the common room is being thought about. It's really hard to set up signs and such since the room shares entrance area with GRUVI.


=============
Merchandising
=============
Angelica received an email from some random CSer who wanted hoodies. They're about $25 to make, and profit should be made this time around. It is agreed that $35 is a practical and reasonable cost of sale.

Noah struts around a little with his black hoodie, doing a bunch of model-like movements. Could this be the future of CSSS?

Hoodie sale would be a big financial investment, however, and we lack funds. Will possibly seek money from SFSS.

Jeff suggests having people preorder them, then adjust our order from the manufacturer depending on that demand.


=============
New CSSS Logo
=============
Tim's been quite busy. but has connections and know how to use them. A graphical-designer is now on board, and something will be made.


Noah struts his stuff again and does some chair dancing while people wait for Travis to scan over the minutes.


==========
Open Floor
==========

Photocopier:
Minolta will come on Tuesday to meet with us at 16:00, location TBA.
 - Double-sided copying is requested, but automatic systems are delicate and often problematic. A disable-able system would be best if situations demand it in the future.
 - New coin box would be nice.
 - Paper tray needs to be robust -- could possibly replace with a metal one ourselves.
 - Eugene will find out how much the current machine had cost us


Approval of minutes:
Travis motions to approve the minutes from the previous meeting; seconded by Omar. Motion passes.


Web team:
The web team hasn't met yet, but a tentative meeting is called for next Wednesday @ 15:30.
Travis requests that a laptop be present at the meeting: shouldn't be a problem.


Jen motions to adjourn. Jeff opposes.

Courteney motions to adjourn. No opposals.


Meeting adjourned at 17:02
