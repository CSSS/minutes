Meeting called to order by Angelica at 15:35

==================
Report of officers
==================

** President: Angelica **
Ski trip has been moved to Apex Resort due to unforeseeable circumstances. The good news is that it is now $30 cheaper, but if you simply must go to Big White/Silverstar at all costs, deposit refunds are available.

Will accompany Jeff to Papa Joe's and try and get us cheaper pizza tomorrow.

CUTC update: read yer email. There are still room for delegates, so by all means, do apply. Just do it by Monday.


** VP Resource: Travis **
Photocopier's going well, and we now have toner. *pause for applause* There is a risk that paper will run out, but a shipment will hopefully arrive Friday.

Pop sales are up, but the pop cabinet lock was vandalized on Thursday night and it's now impossible to get into said cabinet. The lock will be cut to remedy this problem.

New photocopier will arrive January 2nd. Lets hope this one has a much better attitude than the last.

Also, the dream of constructing a giant cylinder out of pop flats has now been realized. There is much applauding at the behemoth's awesomeness.

Travis notes that he is not, in fact, crazy.


** Treasurer: Eugene **
As of Friday, there is roughly $2100 in the account.

Pager and paper bills are yet to be paid, as well as the money for Star Wars movie-day which was outrageously over budgeted by a whole 2 dollars and 61 cents.

Revenue is going up steadily for the pop machine, but copier's is fluctuating.

Income is finally back to what it should have been at the beginning of the semester.

Core funding of $600 will be acquired from SFSS.

Business Objects has yet to pay us. Some bureaucratic and business mambo-jumbo follows. 

Losses from Friday Pizza is still what it has been.

Currently, a bigger budget for the social seems to be possible.


** VP Activities: Jeff **
The Incredibles movie night went exceptionally well, and 25/24 tickets were sold. The difference for the extra sale came of society's funds, but it's tiny.

Arrangements for more tickets will be made. Jeff has connections with the Alberta Motorist Association and they apparently sells deals in cheap cinema passes.

Pizza stuff: We're currently paying $229 without tip for Papa Joe's. Pizza Factory has equivalents for $212, as low as 200 with special deals. Some bartering will be made to lower what we pay Papa Joe's.

Semester end social: Currently budgeted at $850, with about $100 of that going towards buying prizes.

Jeff motions for up to $850 for the semester end social for Fall 2005 with a note that up to $600 of it will be funded by money from SFSS. Jeff amends that the budget be increased to $900. Noah amends that be budget be increased to $950. Dan seconds. Motion passes.

Someone on the floor requests that future movie nights be scheduled for an earlier time.

LAN party: reschedules because of Noah's birthday -- "Damn you Noah!" Now tentatively scheduled for Dec 18


** Secretary: Yang **
As promised, meeting minutes are now being produced with LaTeX. In fact, the meeting notice posters are now also made with LaTeX. Yaaay LaTeX!

Will bring up some UCC updates with VPO's report.


** Exec @ Large: Tim **
Nothing much. Small jobs here and there, yadda yadda yadda.


** VP Operations: Noah **
Amazingly enough, some PR things actually got done.

Faculty of Applied Science meeting was held. To summarize, everyone agrees that there needs to be more joint events with all the departments.

Currently, there is a pub night being held at the beginning of Spring semester, and of course, the AppSci formal.

Also, Communications now has a massive active society compared to before.

Charity events: people are bit tired of work or something. Not much is happening regarding it.

EUSS meeting will be attended.


UCC update: Math 12 is now recommended for 120, and required for 125. Corrections were made to the calendar descriptions of 120, 125, and 128.
A new AppSci admittance model is being put forward to the school, which allows CmptSci applicants to fall back to General AppSci instead of Arts/Sci and should gives us more access to CmpSci candidates.


Travis again reminds the floor that he is not crazy for constructing a ginourmous cylinder out of pop flats. Nope, not crazy. Not crazy at all.

=========
CSSS Logo
=========
It is noted that the proposed logo was originally made for use on the website, a reference to SFU is needed for non-internal usage, and that "C3" seems like a hack on "C^3" which is what the CS student society in that other university over to the west calls itself.

Dan motions to adopt Tim's new kick-ass logo for the CSSS. Dan amends that the new logo is being adopted with the knowledge that modifications will need be made to include reference to Simon Fraser University for external use. A random voting-power holding humanoid seconds. Motion passes.


====================================
Photocopier Coin-op Lock Replacement
====================================
Since we are keeping the same coin-op, the locks should be replaced. Minolta says it'll cost $150. A new coin-op is much, much, much more.


Travis motions for up to $200 for the purpose replacing the common room photocopier coin-op locks and cutting more keys for the new lock. Dan seconds. Motion passes.



============
Tech/Op Fair
============
Due to cancellation of this year's TechFair, it has been proposed that EUSS and CSSS combine TechFair with OpFair into a single event.

Ahmad (OpFair chair) and Troy (TechFair lead) are present.

OpFair situation: is being organized with support from coop office this year and a website is currently being implemented. Companies have been generally happy with the event so far. Currently scheduled for Feb 9th.

TechFair situation: about 80 companies were called, as well as coop sending emails to its entire list: 4 signed up. Companies feel that the event is too passive, and not enough impact are being made.

OpFair allows companies that signed up early to hold sessions.

TechFair's cost of $750 per booth might be a concern since other similar events cost less.

Some companies are looking into actually recruiting -- they feel people aren't prepared enough to come with resumes and such. Possible option is to convince HCCC to run workshops targeted towards TechFair attendees prior to it. Could also give attending companies CDs of student resumes.

Booth setup is insanely expensive. Might attract more companies if they are given major discounts for setting up their own booth.

HCCC has attempted lunch-time networking in the past: apparently didn't work out too well.

It's agreed that CSSS will work together with EUSS for a joint job fair event this year.

If people wants to volunteer, please get in contact with Troy.



===================
Approval of Minutes
===================
Yang motions to approve the previous meeting's minutes with correction for a minor typo. Dan seconds. Motion passes.

Open Floor
==========

John: Merchandising
-------------------
It'll be $1200 something for 50 hoodies. There's roughly 40 preorders so far, plus a few more via email.  

John will get samples for sizing.

Logo will be of School of Computing Science for the reasoning of wanting to attract CSers who are not active within CSSS.

John motions for up to $600 for spending on order of the new CS hoodie. Dan seconds. Angelica amends that it is with the knowledge the cost will be regained quickly. Motion passes.


A random homo sapien motions to adjourn: no objections.

Meeting adjourned at 16:36
