Feb. 18/2004
Meeting called to order at 3:40pm

Report of the Officers:
	Treasurer: Money is good, bank run eventually.
	President: The motion discussed last meeting with the school about lowering 
		entrance GPA passed. 27 to 16 is what Justin heard. The petition is in 
		progress, but we don't know what to do with it. There is a meeting with 
		the CSSS executive and the director next week. We may present the 
		petition there or at the school meeting.
			There is some discussion about the state of the petition and how 
		to make use of it and what to bring up at the meetings. A petition drive 
		is suggested. It is mentioned that it still says motion on it, even 
		though it has passed. A cover letter explaining that the motion has 
		passed is suggested.
	Activities: Wings night and bowling were very successful. ~$170 for 30 people was
		spent at wings night. ~$130 for 23 people at bowling night was spent.
		Aside from reservation trouble bowling went well. Noah is ~$100
		under budget for the two events in total. Movie ticket vouchers will be
		purchased sometime this week or next. 
			LAN party n is next Friday. Rooms are booked, security notified.
		All that needs to be done is to procure veggie plates, juice and soft
		drinks.. Noah asks for assistance in this as he will be out of town until
		Thursday evening.
			Snow tubing at Cypress is coming up on March 7th. Noah would like
		to try and get a group rate and perhaps meet up ahead of time to
		facilitate car pooling.

	*********************************************************************************
	Noah motions for $200 to subsidize snow tubing at Cypress on March 7th. For about
	$5 of subsidy per person for ~40 people. A cost of $10 per person post-subsidy is
	expected. Seconded by Bishnu. Motion passes.
	*********************************************************************************
			Noah is in communication about the App Sci Formal. Possible dates
		are March 26th and April 2nd. Noah prefers the March date as the April one
		is the same day as the semester social. Currently budget details are
		sketchy. Last year tickets were $25. A better DJ than last year and a 
		cash bar is hoped for.
			End of semester social planning is starting, if you want to help
		add yourself to the csss-social mailling list.
			Sera Igglesden, events coordinator for WICS, is planning a
		skating event, possibly on March 20th and possibly with UBC. More info
		later.
			Noah suggests that other things that might get done is another
		wings night, a LAN after the semester end and possibly Kill Bill Volume 2
		if it happens during Noah's tyrannical reign.
	
	Resources: not around.

Open floor:
	Chris asks about the Ramen machine. Andy is unable to find the current contracts.
	Mike may have it. There is some discussion about the current contract and if we 
	ever get paid for it.

	Sundeep asks about budget for LAN party, $150 is budgeted. There is some 
	discussion about Sundeep's gaming list for the LAN party. Justin claims the LAN 
	party will be good this time.

	Justin calls for a motion from the floor.
	*******************************************************************************
	Omar motions to adjourn at 4:00pm. Motion passes
	*******************************************************************************
