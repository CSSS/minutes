3. CS Open House  Call for Projects

-Angelica explains that Open House is a good way for students to meet co-op recruiters, possible compensation in the form of prizes too. Just write a brief summary of project and submit it to her.

4. Open Floor

Security concerns for MTF
-Sera notes there is no cell phone reception in MTF.
-Getting a free phone would not be possible through the SFSS.
-Chris says issue larger than phone questions. Ex. Slipping along road and being alone till the next day. There aren't too many Safewalk ppl (they could be overwhelmed). He suggests putting more lights on the road. Perhaps the unassigned parking spots that no one is taking? Suggests putting meters on them for those with B-Lot passes. Parking Services would patrol.
-Dan T reports that SFU Parking services don't profit from MTF passes, CS only.
-Debra reports that security doesn't understand how frequently we have to use it. Safewalk each time we come down here (to MTF) is not feasible.
-More lights = reduced risk.
-Mike recommends that if you feel uncomfortable at this time, do Safewalk.
-How about Security cameras? Stick em on poles like in the parking lot, although they are not monitored 24/7.
-Noah suggests putting pressure on the School of CS instead of Security.
-Dan T suggests inquiring about the visitor parking spots in front of the MTF.
-Mike will ask about after 8pm-ish spaces, security safewalk, phone (both inside and outside).
-Final note: Debra says that CSSS could probably just create more awareness.

Meeting adjourned at 5:02pm.
