Reports of Officers

Forum Representative's Report:

* Joseph says that nothing has happened yet, the new
SFSS exec is finding their feet.

VP-Activities' Report:

* Finding Nemo: 15 tickets left over, lots of drama
Hulk tickets may be sold in a modified fashion as we
took a bit of a hit on the Italian Job and 2F2F
tickets we exchanged the Nemo tickets for. Next time
pay in advance.

* Next movie is the Hulk on the 20th, Bishnu suggests
purple pants we'll probably have to pay $10

* Mike mentions the money from SFSS for movie tickets

* Eugene motions to do a "The Hulk" movie night on June
20th
Jeremy seconds (rarr)

* Week Of Welcome:

* We have the Friday, we need budget by June 20th.

* We'll probably have to kick in $200 for the
mini-golf course we're doing

* Talk of a WOW barbecue or something

* Wings night is next Tuesday, June 17th

* Eugene motions to spend up to $150 on wings night
Chris Fawcett seconds
motion carries

* LAN Party is this Friday! Woo!

* Eugene is stocking up on goodies for said LAN

* There remains much pop in the back room, thus we will
have more to spend on food this time

* Much in the way of a/v gear and facilities booked,
looks to be a good one!

Treasurer's Report:

* There was some confusion as to whether WICS got their
cheque or not, turns out yes, we have $1000 more than
we thought, yay!

* Weekly gross income is ~600, net is ~270-330

VP-Resources' Report:

* -Thanks to Scott, we have lemon nestea, woo!

* It will go into the machine as soon as we run out of
other stuff

* There are some pop conundrums, time to see if the
order lasts the week

* Floor is clean!@

President's Report:

* MSU travel funding issue is resolved, was transferred
just before it expired -Snack machine and pool table
in MTF!

* Pool table moving expenses are being covered by SFSS
grant

* Recognition, woo, we should probably get a few good
shots of the pool table in use

* Half price computer books stuff: if people mention
the CSSS at half price computer books, we get book
gift certificates tot he tune of 10% of book sales
attributed to it. Since the initial e-mail went out,
$2000 has been sold in our name, so we have $200 in
gift certificates. Perhaps we can use them as prizes...

* Looks like we'll finally get reimbursed for the pizza
we bought for the co-op open house, yay

* New student orientation for CS students June 27th, we
need more volunteers. We'll be running a student
panel, running a booth, doing tour guide stuff and
student demos

* School meeting discussion items were:

* School is having trouble meeting DTO numbers
without letting in people who should perhaps not be here

* Less demand is forcing the entrance GPA down!

* Space, there's issues eh... To the tune of the back
room being eliminated... We need to find a place to
stick our stuff...

* Surrey, there's stuff going on there, talk to mike
later for more details

* The multimedia program combo with fine arts is
getting dropped here in favour of interactive arts at
surrey

* International students will soon be paying a lot more
tuition...

* Foosball, much uncertainty here, company we bought it
from supposedly went under, or maybe the
manufacturer's thought it needed more extensive "testing"


* Banner, we have new one, with the new logo even!

* Tech fair, it's like, happening!

* There were initially some issues with the
coordinator, now settled

Open Floor
