Reports of Officers

Treasurer's Report:

* Ledgers are currently on a laptop being serviced, so
off the of top of his head...

* We have ~$4000, so we can bankroll day to day
operations, a social, some first week events and
maybe even a couple more cheapie (<$300) events.

VP-Resources' Report:

* Resources are A-OK, go Rob!

* In addition, resources have found their way into our
brand spankin' new back room

VP-Activities' Report:

* No more movie nights for the rest of the semester,
we've run out of Hollywood blockbusters for the
summer.

* Terminator 3 movie night had about 15 people going

* Grouse grind climb is this Saturday!

* LAN party will be co-hosted with WICS' old skool game
night, likely starting around 6PM some evening
following finals

* Eugene motions $250 for LAN party
Chris F seconds
motion carries

* Social stuff:

* Budget ~1100-1300

* No barbecue, just pizza due to logistics

* Eugene needs access to a credit card so he can
actually go about buying stuff for the social

Johnson seconds
motion carries

President's Report:

* We got the pool table money, movie money coming

Shad Valley Day

* A day for bright high tech high school kids
participating in the Shad Valley program at UBC to
come up and have a look at our campus

* The school of computing science wants to show them around

* Needs volunteers at $10/hr, go ahead, be selfless!

New mailing list and Back room

* The CSSS is getting a new mailing list, cmpt-students
that will be populated by csilop with all students
taking computing courses, and possibly all majors too

* This is the new cmpt-all for us, as cmpt-all is now
exclusively for announcements form the school,
primarily concerning the CSIL lab

* We also have a new back room next to Tom Shermer's
office. We are almost done evacuating the old back
room/resource room in the old CSIL lab

United Way Charity Event

* If you haven't been attending meetings or reading
minutes, Rob Cameron has proposed that we do a
charity event with united way

* The basic idea is that we refurbish old computers,
give them a bit of a polish, an operating system,
some applications, etc. all for charity

* Yay, there's interest, we're not actually singularly
interested in increasing pop/photocopier revenue just
to see movies!

UCC Report

* There's a whole lotta shakin' going on in UCC, big
meeting tomorrow, the agenda items include:

* New lower division courses: it is proposed to
replace the CMPT 101/201 course sequence with CMPT
120, 121, 221, a three course sequence with a
greater emphasis on being about more than just
programming. The benefits are some exposure to "real"
computing science in first year, allowing those
with prior programming experience to not get bogged
down (there would be an exam available allowing
students to skip 120) while at the same time giving
them less advantage by having a greater breadth of
material in the courses. There would also be an
easier transition into upper division as the
development of skills with new operating systems
and programming languages would be encouraged in 221

* Approval of new MACM 101/201 text selected by the
math department. "Discrete Mathematics with Proof" by
Eric Gosett

* Motion to approve new 400 level course on neural
networks, previously taught as a special topics course

* Motion on approving calendar description change to
the new joint major in computing science and
molecular biology and biochemistry

Open Floor

* Scott Cowan motions to adjourn at 1:20 PM
no objections
meeting adjourned
