Report of the Officers

President:
-no foosball table yet (thinks it will come "next week", apparently it's being shipped by turtles)
-keys to MTF filing cabinet: Mike needs names to those who want them so he can fill out the form
-phone will be in the MTF common room shortly
<Secretary Interrupt>
By "shortly", Mike probably means "next week", which probably means "next semester".
</Secretary Interrupt>

-Tech Fair 2003 meeting at 1:30 this Friday, Mike issues an order to attend(who will follow, nobody knows...)
-AppSci banquet was good, details later with VPA report, Mike wants an invite for next year if it's done again(apparently he thinks he's "graduating"...let's all laugh at his attempt to be funny)
-social funding from SFSS has yet to be approved, it will be taken care of this afternoon by Mike

VPR:
-we have pop
-Pepsi machine: ran out of Brisk at one point, hope to get a refill soon
-selling a lot of pop in there, so that's good, but recycling bins aren't being empty, that's bad(I'm sure we can think of a reason why)

<Secretary Interrupt>
There are about two or three that I missed, but since I don't type 200 WPM, I didn't get them all. The rest declined anyways, but if you're really anal about having them in the minutes, let Chris know what they are. Oh darn, I just spoiled the surprise didn't I.
