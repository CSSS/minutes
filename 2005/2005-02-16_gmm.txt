Report of officers
==================

** President: Angelica **
- we're getting some new sombreros, and the school is financing them. Caraline says we can have a \"C-S-ta\"

- The school is willing to support us for Frosh Week. A meeting with Amanda needs to be arranged

- volunteers needed for following events -- there's food
   * March 4 - Be a CSer for a Day
   * Feb 23 - SFU Surrey Open House: they've offered to buy us dinner at the brew pub
        Fil, Trevor, Travis, Noah and Dan volunteers to attend

- a few execs attended the DSU Brain Pick. Among other things, we found that Engineers hold an exec retreat every year as part of their exec transition -- we should do it too

- Also, insert CaseIT plug here


** VP Operations: Noah **
- Polar Plunge was a big success. Noah got to represent on TV, and got free, Heart Shaped doughnuts.

- Formal banquet & dance: meeting on Thursday (16th) in SFU Pub @ 12:30.
  It appears that we'll be getting more money -- it'll be grand. Also, other schools have been responding

- Need ideas about ways to award volunteers


** VP Activities: Jeff **
Jeff is absent due to sickness, and reports via proxy:
 - Seymour doesn't have enough snow. so, snow tubing is postponed until further notice


** VP Resource: Travis **
- Coke screwed up -- still working on fixing that. We do have pop again, but no root beer

- copier's working well. double-sided charging was broken, but has been fixed

- Terminal's up now, now also with a better monitor. Hooray Surplus!


** Treasurer: Eugene **
- Frutopia's selling almost as well as Coke, and making us lots of moolah

- copier revenue is average

- got a cheque from Pepsi: $213-something. Also $61 from AI vending

- just under $2k in account unallocated -- large deposit last week

- profit margins for pop:
    * when 5-Alive, Nestea, OJ were 80 cents, we lost 5 cents a can. (79 cent with tax per can, plus 5 for deposit and 1 for recycle) They are now priced at 90 cents
    * Was loosing 3cent/can on root beer, so now it's 80 cents
    * Frutopia's making lots of money: 13cent/can


- We're rather well financially


** Exec @ Large: Tim **
- Tim's sick. Haven't done much: last significant job was making OpFair sign

** Secretary: Yang **
- csss-feedback mailling list has been set up -- please do promote the use of it

- Dan enquires about the state of stylesheet for new website: it's still invisible. Noah comments about Yang touching his files. A few people realize how horrible this joke is.

================
Events budgeting
================
- Snow tubing has been cancelled due to lack of snow. We'll wait and see if the weather improves.

- AppSci/Science Social:
JC Pablo has been organizing a joint AppSci/Science social for April 1st and needs man-power and funds to make it happen.
Current budget is ~$5k. Free food & free beer distributed according to ticket stubs that will be handed out at the social.
Concerns are that there's not enough lead-time and not enough DSUs are yet to committed fully.
It's agreed that this is most likely not going to happen this semester, but definitely something to work towards in the future.


- Angelica motions up to $150 for Wings Night; Trevor seconds. Motion carries
- BTW, Wings Night is scheduled for Tuesday, March 8

- Sepand is not in attendance to talk about social budgeting, but is quietly being organized. Yaay, Sepand!


==============
CS Merchandise
==============
School will foot the money. Hooray!

John hasn't actually talk to Amanda yet, but needs ideas; here's some
- hoodies, boxers, toque
- Stickers!
- stationary, not so much, but clip boards are a-okay
- tiny stickers for USB keys
- patches for backpack
- zippy sweater
- hat
- tumblers
- SHOT GLASSES
- water bottle & mugs

School of Computing Science logo will be used


======================
Foosball table upgrade
======================
deferred until next meeting

=================================
Addition of new officer positions
=================================
We'd like more people involved in exec/official capacity, especially first year

Since we won't be getting a lot of first years till September, this topic will be discussed later meetings
