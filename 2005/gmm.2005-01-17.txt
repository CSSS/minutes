==================
Report of officers
==================

** President: Angelica **
Ski trip went well
Furniture is being requested for the atrium
Special semester events have been planned, and events calendar was created

School is holding open house for high-school students on Feb 5th, and wants us to run a booth with games. Red Bull shooter chess is suggested.


** VP Operations: Noah **
Stuff are being done with engineers. Kinesiology and communication, however, have yet to acknowledge this existence.


** VP Activities: Jeff **
Happy that there are already a lot of events planned for the semester and that his job has been made easier. Also, Jeff has "MAD BILLS", as is noted by his t-shirt.


** VP Resource: Travis **
The new photocopier has arrived, but no coin-op, so Travis and Timbo has been hard at work being the human coin-ops.

Update on Ethernet connection to common room: it ain't happened yet.

Lemma has a new domain name: http://csss.cs.sfu.ca


** Treasurer: Eugene **
We've now switched to a new photocopier lease which saves us ~$50/month

Things have been a bit slow, but there are ~$1700 spendable money, after bills and such

Only lost $7 on pizza this week

** Exec @ Large: Tim **
Usual odd jobs.

** Secretary: Yang **
Has finally finished decorating the bulletin board.

*Noah dances a jig*

=========
Noah flips a coin: Exec@Large election will be first.

Exec@Large nominees (nominator followed by second in parenthesis):
- Tim (Jeff, Eugene)
- Max (Dan, Bishnu)
- Sepand (Dan, Angelica)
- Jim (Travis, a random bag of mostly water)
- Nhan (Jeff, Tim)
- Courteney (some present humanoids)

Speech highlights:
- Tim summarizes his speech with one word on the chalk-board: "NO"
- Sepand promises to clean-up the back room. He's an ambitious and brave man.
- Nhan has no idea why he's up there, but he'll be around

Tim is elected to another 4 months


Secretary nominees:
- Sepand will make Timbo clean
- Yang
- Trevor
- Courtney
- Nhan
- John
(Dan attempts to nominates Noah but is met with resistance with hilarious results)

Speech highlights:
- Yang spells sombrero without the m. Sombrero Man strikes!
- Now that Sepand isn't the lackey, he promises to make Timbo clean up the back room
- John requests assistance in his manhunt

Yang is elected, completing the exact same exec line-up as the previous semester.
