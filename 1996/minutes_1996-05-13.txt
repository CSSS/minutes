CSSS Minutes for May 13th

Elections/Positions of Power 

Jason Reader is the new president 
Carolann Mercer became vice president 
William Whittaker became secretary and volunteered for the hardware/software committee 
No Treasurer was elected 
Blair Leggett became the new head of the Activities and Resources Committee 
Peter Csapo continues to take care of the photocopier 

Laser Tag 

A laser tag outing was suggested for Wednesday May 29th this passed 6 for, 5 abstentions. 

Microwave 

The microwave is dead, again.  It was suggested that it not be fixed due to a general dislike of the attitude taken by some students who demand the CSSS provide microwave service.  Concerns were also raised about the lack of cleanliness and the problems of silverfish and mouse droppings due to the food left around. 

Pizza 

Pizza for a buck a slice and 50 cent pop continues to be sold every Friday at 4pm in the Applied Science Building outside the CSSS common room.
