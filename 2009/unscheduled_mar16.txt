Max Whitney is taking minutes. He is probably not a member due to having graduated, and therefore is not voting.

Dave Hughes calls this meeting to order at 3:30 pm on March 16. He moves to appoint Kyle Sakai to chair. The motion passes.

Dave explains that this meeting is to discus the credibility and conduct of the IEC. Dave leaves. Kyle Jung notes that we have already had a long discussion regarding emails sent earlier by Kyle Sakai.

Edmond Cheung motions that this meeting recommend that the CSSS should investigate the IEC and should call an Emergency General Meeting as soon as possible to further this discussion. Chris Walters seconds. Chris Parsons arrives. The motion passes.

The meeting concludes at 3:40 pm.
