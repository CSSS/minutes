- mpede asks for $100.00

7) Policy Changes and ADDITIONS

1) Cheque policy

- eolynek wants cheque policy changed so cheque receivers, if they have signing authority, cannot sign their own cheques

- vote cannot occur for another 2 meetings (minimum of 4 weeks)

- formal writing to be written up next CSSS Exec meeting

- will be put in as a standing order

- eolynek would like to put in place a "cheque book at SFU" policy

- rrispin says no, cheque book is needed for Costco runs and other off-campus purchases

- eolynek also disagrees with habit of signing blank cheques; would like to see particular destination for cheques written in

3) Insurance for Sponsored Events

- some insurance for machines damaged during Social Events

- eolynek would like to have owners set up machines themselves, verify that everything is working, then Society is in charge. At the end of the event, owner will re-check the machine, and then it is owner's responsibility again.

- eolynek thinks obligation begins when on-campus (because systems may be damaged before coming on to campus)

- rrispin brings up sensitivity of monitors and harddrives; easily damages during transport to campus

- rrispin suggests that CSSS should cover transport (trucks can be rented for $100/day) However, this will take time

- mpede suggests have people go in place of organizer to pick up computers. Can VPA empower people to monitor "false accidents"

- cgs suggests splitting into two issues - one for on-campus time and one for transportation

- mpede asks for table of motion; rrispin asks for resolution since he will not be at next meeting

- eolynek suggests letting motion for a Standing Order wait until summer (for next executive to deal with) and the current Exec will pass a motion binding for this semester's social event only

- eolynek asks that the CSSS officially approve of $$ paid to rrispin for computer damage

- rrispin's damage:

- Sound Blaster Live! (full version) 
- 3Comm 905B 
- ASUS V3800 Deluxe 
- 64 MB PC100 CAS2 RAM 
- 300W Power Supply 
- MOTION: eolynek raises motion to reimburse rrispin for damage done to his machine during 99-3 Semester Social, cdemwell seconds

2 abstentions, 7 in favour

8) Blairs DVD Player

- rrispin suggests not bothering to look into it since a new one costs $229.00 (with one year warranty)

- mpede says $100.00 will repair machine

- mpede asks if we should commit to getting a DVD player for CSSS; put off due to lack of funds

9) 2nd Photocopier

- cdemwell and rrispin firmly opposed to idea

- cgs looking into costs, faster machine? cgs will bring facts to next meeting

- cdemwell suggests getting a plastic cover for machine when not working

- general concerns about space and power for second machine

10) RAM

- eolynek requests that it be tabled due to lack of CSSS funds

11) Open Floor

- MOTION: cgs makes motion to donate "triangle thing" couch, to SFSS
