Resource Room:
- Micha isn't here to make a report

- Motion will be tabled until next semester when someone takes over the resource room management from Micha.

Photocopier:
- Andrew says that he received a fax frlom Minolta guaranteeing a 5 year service contract.
- Unfortunately the contact is on holidays for 2 more weeks. He asked for details of the lease agreement but hasn't heard back from them yet.
- General consensus is that the copier needs to be replaced.
- The copier is over 1,000,000 copies.
- Andrew will talk to them and at least get them to service the machine.

Banks:
- Dario says Royal Bank is the best, without a doubt.
- All the banks send their coin to Royal Bank, so that is why the other banks have a fee.
- It'll cost us about $200 less for each deposit. Royal Bank is THE place to go.

-------------
Motion: Create a bank account at Royal Bank and transfer all funds from Scotia Bank, and notify the SFSS within the next 2 weeks.
