Web Contest

Issue : Contest not officially announced, but Matt Fraser has already made
a page..  Allocated as prizes by the CSSS was $300 and 2 gravis cards.
Unofficial deadline was the end of August

Decision : Should Matt get the prize or should we get competition for him? 
It would be unfair to wait longer since we are displaying his page
currently.

Decision : Should Jason be Webmaster of the page?

Webmaster should be approved by Elma.

Paul Olynek suggest we hold another contest and compensate Matt for his
work he has already done.
Proposition by Geoff Denning : Award Matt 1st prize ($150 and 2 Gravis
cards) and use both his page and Anti-Calendar.
