A letter from Hattie Aitken (hattie@sfu.ca), the SFSS Union Fieldworker,
about:

>Minutes for Sept 25th
>CSSS General Meeting
________________________________________________________________________________
Dear Michael and CSSS members,

I am writing to correct some statements appearing in the minutes of the
25th, and to clarify a few things:

>SFSS Funding
>$300 semester available from SFSS

$200 per semester is automatically provided for the Core Budget--day to day
stuff including up to $100 in food for socials/meetings etc.  The SFSS
routinely pays  your common room phone bills out of this amount.

Grants are provided upon request and presentation of appropriate/relvant
documentation to the Committee for Departmental Student Unions, for special
events or projects not covered by the core in funds or scope.  Examples:
anticalendar production, careers days, film nights, endowment fund startup
funds, pub nites, speaker series, conference attendance, fieldtrips etc.

Loans are immediately available through this office for socials ($400 max,
repayable w/in 2 weeks), and through CDSU for resaleable inventory
purchase, eg. t-shirts--negotiable repayment dates.

>A loan from the department is possible if needed.

Are you speaking of the careers day situation, or generally saying that the
department will provide funds on a loans basis?  Because the CSSS is an
SFSS organisation, if it contracts with another body for repayable funds or
charged services, the SFSS would be liable should there be any problems for
the CSSS re:fulfilling payment obligations.  Consequently, the SFSS doesn't
allow it's unions/clubs/affiliates to enter into 3rd party agreements of
this sort.
Besides, you could get the loan from the SFSS in the first place.
>
>Richard is for taking the SFSS funds
>Kaye is against taking SFSS funding.
>
>Hattie doesn't want to hear complaints from Computing Students saying that
>they are not provided enough by their student society.

I said that **if** the CSSS takes a position refusing any SFSS funding, I
didn't want to hear complaints about lack of support or funding as I have
heard in the past, even when the SFSS **has** provided funding the the
CSSS.
>
>Precedent : We have taken funds from SFSS for Pub night last Summer
>Semester

There are lots of other instances of the provision of SFSS funds directly
to the CSSS.

>
>Hattie thinks that a stance on taking SFSS funds should be established.

I suggested that **IF** the CSSS takes a position on this, that the
decision be minuted and sent to Forum along with a letter detailing the
CSSS perspective on mandatory membership and assessment of mandatory fees
that go along with it.

I need to add here that access to SFSS funding is a given, and a right, of
all student unions, therefore of the CSSS.  Should the present membership
take a decision of this sort, it would not be binding on future
configurations of CSSS members as the right to funding exists outside of
any semester's active membership in CSSS.  If the point some of you really
want to make is to do with the lack of choice in membership and fees
assessments, that could be done as I've suggested above, without having to
vote on not now or ever accepting SFSS funding.


Please circulate these responses to your membership for clarification,  thanks.

Hattie
