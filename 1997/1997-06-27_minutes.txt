Meeting :

----------------------------------------------

Adam Coath spoke about the CSSS Anti-Calendar
	A contest is being held in regards to the CSSS Webpage and
Anti-Calendar.
The contest awards prizes for the creation of online pages that can keep
track of Computing Science activities, host a forum for student opinion
about courses/profs, post CSSS executive material and more.
	The contest committee had $200 and 2 Gravis sound cards to allocate as
prizes, and requests another $100 and volunteers for judges.  Then the prize
money distribution would be as follows :
 	$150 First Prize     $100 Second Prize     $50 Third Prize
The Gravis cards would go to first and second and mugs would be given as
consolation prizes.

Email Adam Coath (coath@sfu.ca) for more detailed information.

Motion by Adam Coath to give an extra $100 to the contest.
	Seconded by Jason Reader
13 for, 2 abstentions
Motion Passed.

----------------------------------------------

Science Alive donation was suggested once again.  Jason Reader was the one
who came before us this day to ask for the usual $1000 standard donation we
usually, and will, give to them.
Science Alive organizes activities and camps for children to explore
science.  It encourages female attendance to such events and is a truly
noble cause.

The Treasurer reported that at his last check the CSSS has an estimated
$800-$900 balance in its bank account, and that perhaps the $1000 donation
should wait until the end of the semester.

----------------------------------------------

Volleyball is subsidized by the CSSS to any willing to join the upcoming
Applied Science tournament.

----------------------------------------------

Movie Night - The first Friday of July CSSS is going to Men In Black (MIB)
	Signs and Signup sheets are up and each person is required to pay $5.
Students are allowed to bring a friend at this rate.  The Engineers are
interested in joining us.

----------------------------------------------

The price of Nescafe
	If you wish to dispute this, please talk to Richard Walters.  He has
currently dropped the price to $1.25 on the condition that it not be dropped
on Fridays.

----------------------------------------------

The Pub Night
	25-30 people took our invitation and signed their names at the door
stating
that they were guests of the CSSS.  The seating at the pub was sold-out and
the music was enjoyable.

----------------------------------------------

Careers Day
	There is interest from companies in knowing if we are going ahead
with the
event soon.  We need a contact person to oversee the arrangements.  It is
ideal that it bee in either the next 4 weeks, or into the beginning of the
next semester.

Paul Olynek and Richard Walters volunteered to help with the arrangements.

----------------------------------------------

Final Social
	Unfortunately, Kaye Mason was unable to attend this meeting in order to
present this topic to its full extent.  There is interest in showing
Red-Dwarf in the Atrium, renting the Gladiator again, perhaps another BBQ.
There is some tension between us and the cafeteria as to wether or not we
can hold another BBQ, since it is hot food served within their jurisdiction.

Email Kaye at katherim@sfu.ca for further information.

----------------------------------------------

Paul Olynek spoke about a recent issue brought up in forum.  Do we wish to
have a spring break in either the middle or the end of spring semesters, or
even one at the end of every semester before finals.
	After much discussion around the room, a general favor was cast towards
having a break before finals, every semester.  Paul will take this opinion
back with him to the next forum meeting.
