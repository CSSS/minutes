Meeting :

Motion by Jodi Gornett to suport the Pub Night as a social event, in
spirit.
	Seconded by Michael Pede
5 for, 2 abstained

Adaline Cheam, as representative for the Pub Night event, announced that
the cover charge would be $3 for students, $5 otherwise.  The pub was
expected to reach capacity of 250 for the night.

Discussion pointed out that we had 4 options :
1.	Support the event in principle only.  No allocations of funds.
2.	Pay for our portion of the event without grant money.
3.	Get and give grant for Pub Night funding.
4.	Give them the grant money, and then some of our own because we're great
people


Motion by Jodi Gornett to agree to ask for funding to put towards the Pub
Night

5 for, 1 against, 2 abstentions

Pub Night.

A happy attendance content that the problem put before them had come to a
conclusion they could live with, they waited only for the meeting to be
adjourned

Motion by Richard Walters to adjourn the meeting.
	Seconded by Mattias Andersson
