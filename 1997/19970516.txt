Meeting:
________


Motion put forward that votes be done by secret ballot
Vote (done by show of hands :) ) was to not vote by secret ballot.


Elections:

President:

Kaye was nominated - accepted.
Jason Reader was nominated - accepted.
Jodi was nominated - declined.
Erick was nominated - declined.

Speeches were given by by Kaye and Jason.

The vote was a tie, so we counted the votes again, and again ... and again
...

The candidates were informed of the situation, and Jason removed himself
from running, so Kaye won by a default of some sort.


Vice-President:

Jodi,
Jason Reader,
Grant,
Adam were all nominated and they all accepted.
Geoff Rispin,
Paul,
Erick were all nominated and they all declined.

Jodi, Grant and Adam gave speeches.

Declining nominmees were:

Erick all declined nominations.

Michael won the vote.

ARC (supposedly Activities and Resources Director :) ):

Grant,
Geoff Rispin were nominated and they accepted.
Blair,
Geoff Denning,
Erick,
Laura,
Ryan,
"The mysterious stranger in the corner" were all nominated but declined.

Grant won the vote and was informed: "You won."
His response was: "Does that mean I get it or not?"

There was some talk of being tired of the ARCxists and Leninists.


In short, the new exexutive Committee is:

President: Katherine Mason
Vice-President: Jason Reader

Rest of the meeting:

"We have $384.55"


Volunteer committees:

UCCC:
Richard walters nominated himself and Adam.
Jodi volunteered himself.

Hardware/Software committee:
Geoff and Geoff were nominated, and they accepted (I think).


Constitution:

The web page will have a copy of both the old one, and the proposed new
one.

Next CSSS meeting will have more discussion about the constitution.

There was a vote for a new committee, and the vote was for it. (Who knows
what this is.  I can't understand my notes here.)


There was talk of a joint event with the Engineers to go to see Lost
World.  I think ARC was given this responsibility.

And that was about it.
