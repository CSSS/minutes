Awards:
CSSS is looking into what we should do about the CSSS Bursary currently
named Kazuya Shinyashiki Memorial Award in Computing Science.

Some possibilities suggested were to change the name back or change the
name back and create a new award in memory of Kaz.
Erick was to be asked to approach the family with the suggestion.

Treasurer's Report:
We are currently in debt about $200-$300.

Coke Machine:
What to do?
Get it fixed, or get old one back were suggestions.

ARC:
Geoff is currently looking over the money situation with Richard and is
hoping to be able to plan some events in the near future.  He is also
looking into the possibility of having some network games in the PC lab as
a competition.

Disband SFSS:
It was decided that the official CSSS position on this matter is a neutral
one.  Yet on the matter of the health plan, we will look into what we can
do.

Open floor:
A point was raised about problems with the electoral process of the CSSS
relating to the first meeting of the semester's elections.  A suggestion
was made for secret ballots.  This will be looked into and it was noted
that at the beginning of the meeting a motion can be put forward to have
the elections done by secret ballot.  It was also suggested that this be
put into the Constitution.

Jason Reader is currently attempting to revise the Constitution.

The topic of modem access was brought up and it was decided that the CSSS
will look into what can be done and/or what we can do about the situation
of modem access time.

The meeting closed at 3:24 pm.
