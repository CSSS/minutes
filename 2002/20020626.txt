Reports of officers:

President's report:
-Colin has recently had a meeting with Elizabeth Zook to resolve outstanding issues. One of the major issues is the CSSS scholarship, it will be awarded in the amount of $2000 to someone active in the CSSS. The selection process has yet to be formalized, but it's something to be worked on.
-They also discussed the situation with TA's, they occasionally leave something to be desired. Send your thoughts to Colin.
-We have been participating in the organization of weeks of welcome events. We have submitted price breakdowns to the SFSS, they like the breakdowns. We may not be able to do the proposed LAN party without applying for a grant. Other societies are considering participating in the mini golf, so we may be able to allocate some funds to LAN party. Details to be worked out.
-The web site: The path has been cleared to put the web site back up, we need to talk to sumo, or rather sumo's replacement to get it back up. Colin also believes we should formalize the web site release process, given the events of last semester, there is consensus.
-Dario asks about lemma: it is currently at Chris D.'s house, can be brought up at any time. Ian notes that CSILop is willing to put lemma in their machine room, details to be worked out.

VP-R's report:
-Coke machine and photocopier are well stocked, no problems since last meeting.
-Rob would like it if someone could be on hand on Tuesday mornings, so he doesn't have to skip class again

VP-A's report:
-We continue to lose an average amount on pizza, though it's accounted for.
-There is some debate as to when to see MIB II, in the end those pushing for opening night, Wednesday July 3rd, win out.

Secretary's report:
-We continue to have biweekly meetings, and we've even managed to get minutes approved, this is a good thing, yay!

Treasurer's Report:
-We have ~$3300 in liquid assets, ~$1200 in inventory and ~$1000 in liabilities.
-The SFSS is advertising a 6 cent photocopier, this means war! More advertising! More Flyers! More page space in the peak!

Edward from physics speaks to us:
-They want free pizza.
-Colin offers them 1/2 price pizza.
-Edward notes that they are good customers.
-Angelica raises the motion to offer 3 half price pizzas to the physics student association, Dario seconds, motion clearly passes.
-The CSSS is invited to the next rocket launch.

Angelica makes a report on Techfair:
-There will be a 2-day fair. Costs are estimated between $7 500 and $8 000. Expected income is between $10 500 and $13 000. This year we are getting some money ahead of time, so dead beats won't be as big a problem. There is no new information on collaboration with HCCC.

Open Floor:
-Web site release process: There seems to be a need to formalize the delivery of content to the web site, just to make sure everything is hunky-dory.
-Colin wants to increase active membership! A newsletter, spam, banners? There is no shortage of ideas, keep this in mind people.
-SFU at surrey - Colin is going to an information session tonight, will report back next meeting.

Stuff for agenda next meeting:

End of semester social
