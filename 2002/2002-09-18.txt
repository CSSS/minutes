Meeting called to order at 3:40 by Colin. Why didn't you put your name
on the attendance sheet?

Selection of committee members:
UCC: Shaun, Noah, and Bishnu
CRC: Angelica and Jessica

Better late than never we approve the minutes of meetings on September 4th and July 22nd.

President's Report:
-CSIL is moving to the multi-tenant facility in discovery park in the spring semester and will remain there for the next three years until ASB 2 is built.
Downside(s): 3.5 minute walk if you walk as fast as Chao, 7 minute walk if you walk as fast as everyone else.
Upside(s): New 780 sq. foot common room. A wireless laptop lab which we have decided will host LAN parties in the future.
Other points: All computers will be in one room and the entire area will be card access. All new desks and chairs. We also get 35-40 parking spots which we can buy for $35/month from the department to do with as we wish.

-Lemma(our server) is now back up on campus and collecting dust in the back room rather than Chris Demwell's basement. Noah has/has been volunteered to rebuild it to working condition.

-We need to put up a proposal to Crystal Decisions because they have expressed interested in funding some events in exchange for exposure up on campus. A committee has been formed to do this: Angelica, Noah, Andy, Chris, Jessica all volunteer. Sundeep is assumed to be appointed to this committee since he is VPA.

VPR Report:
Resources are good. Shaun said to put it on record that he does his job. This is questionable but nobody objected to his request so here it is: Shaun does his job.

Pop stockpile seems to deplete rapidly over the weekend(Who is up here drinking all our pop on the weekend). It is suggested that we make pop orders every Friday. A compromise is reached in that we will do pop orders alternating with Costco runs each week.

Eugene Report (VPA Report by proxy):
Here is what Sundeep wants:
White board - 2"x4" (Sounds a little small. Perhaps he means 2'x4') on stand used to advertise Friday movies, upcoming events, dates and locations. Cost ~$30. No motion is made.

Simpsons Marathon - Friday Oct 4th, 2002 at 2:30pm in AQ3181. (note: It has since been discovered that this room is not booked by us until 4:30pm) There will be pizza at 4:00pm and 10:00pm. Cost is $10 for rental and $50 for pizza lost. No motion is made.

LAN Party 6 - Friendly Fire Off^H^H^H on dammit!
October 18th in the Atrium starting at 5:00pm. Pizza at 3:20pm and 11:00pm. Costs are $50 for pop, $40 for pizza loss, and $20 for timbits. No motion is made.

Wings night - October 29th at the SFU pub. Wings and nachos will be subsidized. Costs will be $125 for wings + $25 for nachos. He expects a $75 recovery for a net loss of $75. No motion is made.

CSSS Gathering Unknown - A mysterious event for approximately 100 people to hopefully be sponsored by Crystal Decisions. We need ideas for this event... Bowling, expensive dinner, swimming pool rental, anything else? Costs are unknown but Sundeep expects that we will get $1000~$1500~$2000 from Crystal Decisions plus $400 from attendees at $4/each. A motion is made by Noah to pursue organizing this and that funding be approved once there is a better plan. Bishnu seconds. Motion passes.

Movie events:
-November 22nd. James Bond - Die Another Day.
50 tickets * $13.50/ticket = $675.00 cost. $500 would be recovered from ticket sales. This leaves us with a $175 subsidy.
-December 13th. Star Trek X - Nemesis.
50 tickets * $13.50/ticket = $675.00 cost. $500 would be recovered from ticket sales. This leaves us with a $175 subsidy.
-December 18th. Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers.
75-100 tickets * $13.50/ticket = $1012.50-1350.00 cost. $750-1000 would be recovered from ticket sales. This leaves us with a $262.50-350.00 subsidy.
No motions are made for any of the movies.

Financial motions were not made because of recommendation by the treasurer due to our financial situation to be explained below.

Treasurer Report:
Due to key issues he couldn't get into the back room to count money but can tell us this much: We have money back there, we have money in the pop machine, and we have some money in the copier too. The back account has upwards of $10000 but $7500 is still a loan from the SFSS for techfair.

Open floor:
-The department is accepting proposals for what to do with the extra money made through the tuition differential. If you have an idea please feel free to submit it to the department.

-There are keys missing. If you are a past exec and still have keys please bring them back to the key office. Even better would be to bring your successor with you so that they don't have to pay for having new keys cut.

-Shaun is filtering spam from csss-exec. Not everyone likes this idea that some mail has to go through shaun before it gets to the maillist.

-Meeting time: Current meeting time is not good for everyone. A new one will be discussed informally. Colin is considering Friday afternoons.

-Week of Welcome: Do we owe the SFSS money? Was sundeep's spending on the LAN party approved? We aren't really sure about these anymore. Someone suggested that we blame the SFSS (That was supposed to be off the record, oops). Other suggestions were that we blame Entropy or the EUSS. All good ideas because they don't involve blaming ourselves. Officially nobody is to blame yet.

Lets get out of here (motion to dismiss).

Meeting adjourned at 4:45pm.
