Reports of officers:

President's report:
-TechBC stuff: E. Zook reports that at SFU surrey, they expect to push the current students through the program, and then try to wind it down. People at SFU surrey say that they plan to enlarge enrollment to 600 next year, 800 the year after. As it stands the programs remain separate, their curriculum differs greatly from ours, but there is some duplication (like SW Engineering). They are also better funded. Lots of other stuff remains to be worked out.

-Colin has also recently spoken to Chao regarding the future of CSIL and the common room. Apparently there is talk of moving CSIL and potentially the common room to discovery park. People donUt seem to like this idea. There is also talk of another building being built, but this is fairly far off in the future.

VP-R's Report:

-Rob has been faithfully refilling the pop machine and photocopier, like a good little VP-R.
-Exciting news: We now have Vanilla coke! (Thanks to Colin's girlfriend, Witty). After an extensive reshuffling of Sprite and the removal of C-Plus, the Vanilla coke found itself below the diet coke in the pop machine.
-The VP-R Pager: It's pretty close to dead, we are looking at getting a new pager or potentially plan. Colin proposes we take over his girlfriend's pager, as she is apparently getting quite a deal, but it seems as though maintaining our number is of greater importance, as a number of important contacts (coke, minolta, Tech Fair companies) already actively use the pager number to get in touch with us.

VP-A's Report:
-Doug has prepared an outline of the social, an outline of proposed activities with proposed budget is attached.
-People raise concerns over geek olympics: Angelica raises concerns over the organization of teams, ahead of time, or on the day of, as there have been numerous complications before with scheduling/availability of competitors. Noah says he believes that the geek olympics are about showmanship more than anything, should try to get teams together beforehand.

Treasurer's Report:
-Ian outlines our current financial status:
Bank Account    $2159.06
Pizza Cash        $ 100.00
Petty Cash        $ 211.32
Cash on Hand    $1451.39
Inventory        $ 750.00
Assets Total:    $3921.67
Liabilities:    $2137.31

Overall:        $2534.36

-Ian suggests that a less ambitious social given the current budget situation, Ian recommends a $1000 social budget. This amount may go up once some financial tidbits are settled with other student groups for WoW.

End of Semester Social:
-Given budgetary concerns, Doug wants to settle some issues with the social. There seems to be agreement that the carnival mall is somewhat ambitious, both in terms of activity and finances, and is perhaps better left for fall.
-There is also concern over competition with food services/renaissance, to be worked out.
-A committee is created for the purposes of refining the activities and budget of the social. Pete remembers a kafuffle involving having to purchase some burgers from the cafeteria in the past.
-Angelica L. motions that $1100 be allocated to the end of semester social with $300 to be recouped.


Secretary's report:
-Meetings continue as scheduled, will strive to have hard copies of minutes for approval next time, will not rely on having working wireless network on campus.

Forum rep's report:
-Pete has attended the first and only (so far) forum meeting of the semester. Most of this meeting was spent discovering what forum indeed was. In the past forum had power, but now they're and advisory committee for the most part.
-Actual issues of concern are changes to GP-24, the policy that governs our computer use, which is changing, and apparently involves easier snooping of our e-mail.

Tech Fair report:
-Angelica has been in contact with Futureworks, an organization that places students, recent graduates, or others that are unemployed or on E.I., in high tech and science related jobs. They really want to come, but can't pay. There seems to be consensus.
-At present the number of companies attending is not entirely clear, but we are actively in touch with a number of them.

Open Floor:
-Mike motions to go see Austin Powers 3, Ian adds a friendly ammendment to place a spending limit of $100, Rob seconds, motion passes.
-Ian motions to adjourn, Angelica seconds, meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM
