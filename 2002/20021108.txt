Angelica has a proposal to make to the cmpt department about the CSIL
move.
-We are getting a wireless lab in the new CSIL
-Proposal includes a request to have an aditional wireless lab in the ASB
-Several ways that this 'may' be implemented by the department
-The proposal also requests that we keep our back rooms after moving down to the new CSIL.
-For full details about this proposal contact alimb@sfu.ca

-Colin points out that the department might not like it if we say we don't want it down in the new csil but it might be better to still ask for something up in the ASB.

-Perhaps split it into 2 proposals.

-Also noted that the resource room is not entirely necessary. Sure, it is Ian's bedroom and stuff, but what else do we use it for?

Computing Science Open House
-Angelica talked to the co-op people about this.
-6 projects from the Burnaby campus and 6 projects from SFU @ Surrey campus would be chosen to show their projects to companies invited to campus for this event.
-Proposals for projects should go to the co-op office.
-Consensus from those in atendance is that they would want at least 2 months to prepare a project.
-It is also felt that this event would need good advertising in order to succeed.
