Meeting called to order at 3:40 PM by the president, the room is refreshingly chilled.

President's report:
-Everyone important he needs to talk to is on vacation, hilarity ensues.
-Keys are ready for the executives.
-The web site is down, will stay that way at least until Elizabeth Zook gets back, need to settle issues when she gets back.

VP-R's Report:
-The masses applaud their VP-R for his placement of propaganda on the common room walls.
-Pop machine is being filled daily, good stock of pop has been built up.
-Photocopier is having trouble, is being serviced, repair guy was here today, will be back later.
-Getting a business costco card would be a good thing, last semester cards were purchased for Shaun W. and Dan T., and getting a hold of them to make pop runs is problematic at best.
-Costco is a good thing, flat of pop from coke $11+, Costco $8, the card will pay for itself in one run (~17 flats of coke)
-Pete L. notes that we get the pop machine for free by coke's good graces, so we should be sure not to get on their bad side by ordering our soft drinks from Costco. It is generally agreed that we should ensure we make some orders from coke as to not raise suspicion, but make a few costco runs to save money.
-Noah A. Motions: That the CSSS purchase a business costco membership. asks that motion be deferred until next meeting as Dan T. notes that we may be able to acquire a costco card through the SFSS.
-Rob brings up the issue of the exam file, it's noted that we could potentially put the exam file online, but there may be copyright issues involved. It is then noted that we could have exam file office hours, or provide some method to contact an exec to get access to the exam file. Bishnu B. noted that the exams are rather outdated. It is also brought up that traditionally, a free pop was awarded for each new exam added ot the cabinet. Bishnu B. and Ryan I. volunteer to help with the exam file.

-Chris Demwell arrives fashionably late, algorithms textbook in tow.

-Rob then mentions the issue of common room air quality, both in terms of temperature and odour. Chris coincidentally happens to have a fan marked CSSS, was thrown out by a previous executive who saw it as unnecessary.

-Rob notes that the little box in the common room is indeed not a suggestion box, but in fact a quote of the week box.

-Ian begins his treasurer's report, outlines a budget:
Revenue                        Expenses
Photocopier        $3200            Activities        $1500
Pizza            $1000            Donations        $500
Pop            $3200            Phone            $130
SFSS            $400            Copier(monthly)        $670
Total:            $7800            Copier(copy)        $1024
                        Pizza            $1360
			                        Pop            $2200
						                        Misc.            $500
									                        Total:            $7884

												VP-A's report:
												-LAN party is coming
												-We are low on cash, perhaps only one movie night, as we have already had a movie night (Star Wars: Episode II)
												-Pizza night is losing some more money than usual, last time it was $15 unaccounted for, options include better security or higher prices. Doug favours better security. Ian offers to provide an accounting breakdown. There is discussion about money being lost and better security. Essentially new security measures involve forcing people into a line with cash out, rather than a free for all.
												-Also, there has been some trouble with getting tables, asking the bridge club for the tables they take up could be useful.
												-Contact Doug with any ideas you may have for events (dbruvall@sfu.ca).

												Secretary's Report:
												-Frequent meetings are good, be on the look out for meeting notice in the near future.
												-Send potential agenda items to csss-exec@sfu.ca

												LAN Party III:
												-This can potentially be done at zero cost, no one seems to want to fund it, so we will give it a try
												-Budgeting for other events is discussed.
												-Angelica L. Motions: To allocate $20 to the LAN party, seconded by Noah Adams, Friendly amendment by Ian H. to up the amount to $50, approved unanimously... Well, scratch that zero cost bit, but $50 isn't too bad.

												While we're on the topic of entertaining diversions, the meeting decides to take an entertaining diversion off of the agenda, the topic of movies is raised:

												-Ryan I. motions to allocate an amount not exceeding $200 to see MIB II, Ian H. seconds, motion clearly passes.
												-Ryan I. motions to allocate $200 for Austin Powers 3, seconded by Ian H., motion is defeated.
												-Dario A. motions to allocate $200 to see minority report, Bishnu B. seconds, motion is defeated.

												-Before leaving, Pete L. makes a note about some inappropriate jokes that have been made in the common room of late, they're not funny, and they create a hostile atmosphere, please don't make them.

												Weeks of Welcome:
												-SFSS wants to work with us for weeks of welcome, potential events are mini golf or a LAN party

												-Bishnu outlines a request the department has made. They would like us to prepare some kind of survival pack for incoming students, but only those who are declared...grumble...grumble... (grumbling added by secretary who at the time of the meeting wasn't feeling particularly fond of declared majors, has since changed view as a result of certain e-mail from certain computing science advisors.)

												-Ian motions: That $250 be allocated for expenses involved in weeks of welcome, with the intention that portions be recovered, seconded by Noah, motion clearly passes

												CSSS Barbecue:
												-Doug discusses the potential for a CSSS barbecue, we own barbecues, it might be nice to use them. In the past there were barbecues, but there haven't been one in a while. There is potential to combine with the social.

												Open Floor:

												-The social will be an agenda item for the next meeting.

												-Thanks to Angelica for the Ice Cream!

												-Noah motions to adjourn, Ian seconds, clearly passes before we lose quorum. Meeting is adjourned at 4:45 PM.
