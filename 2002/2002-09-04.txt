Suffice it to say, this meeting has one agenda item, and its a biggie:

Elections:

President:
-Noah nominates Colin, Angelica seconds
-Bishnu nominates Mike Schwartz, he declines
-Bishnu nominates Trevor, he declines

-Colin wins by acclamation.


VP-Resources:
-Nominations and declinations occurred at too great a rate to effectively record, also Bishnu has GTA 2 on his laptop...
-And when it was all said and done, Shaun was the only man left
standing.

-Shaun wins by acclamation


VP-Activities:
-Shaun nominates Sundeep, though Sundeep is not here, he has left Shaun with a rather extensive letter of acceptance. Angelica seconds.

-Sundeep wins by acclamation.


Secretary:
-Angelica nominates Trevor, Noah seconds
-Dany nominates Eugene, Bishnu seconds
-Eugene nominates Morgan, Bishnu seconds
-Several others are nominated and subsequently decline at a truly unbelievable pace

-Bishnu bashing ensues in the election speeches.

-And again this semester the race for secretary is most furious of them all, and the winner, by a nose, and maybe some votes too, is Trevor.


Treasurer:
-Noah nominates Bishnu, Eugene seconds.
-Doug nominates Sigal, Eugene seconds.

-Bishnu is victorious


Committee appointments:
-Noah motions to defer appointment/election of committee members to next meeting, Eugene seconds, motion carries.

And for those not wanting to read through all that, your CSSS executive for the 2002 fall semester consists of:
President:        Colin Johnston
VP-Resources:        Shaun Webb
VP-Activities:    Sundeep Parmar
Secretary:        Trevor MacPhail
Treasurer:        Bishnu Bhattacharyya

Colin reports on Crystal Decisions:
-The CSSS has had a meeting with Crystal decisions, they want to have increased visibility on campus, and we, as always, want money, so this is something to think about...

Colin reports on the CSSS Award:
-$500 will be awarded to someone active in the society. The application deadline has already passed, so Colin has talked with Elizabeth Zook and he will make the decision it seems.

-Additionally, Colin has addressed the department about problems with TAs and in fact, something has come out of it, there will be a 45 minute orientation for TAs (hey, you gotta start somewhere).

Clubs Days:
-Were not quite sure when we will have a table, but we will! and it will need volunteers

-Noah motions to adjourn, there is no opposition, meeting is adjourned at 4:41 PM
